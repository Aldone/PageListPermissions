Page List Permissions
=====================

This module is intended as a helper module and/or UI extension to User Groups,
making it possible to view and edit Page permissions directly from Page List.

User Groups is fully functional without Page List Permissions and the intention
here isn't to add anything really "new" to it's core feature set, just to solve
certain permission management issues / needs by providing an alternative UI.

## Installing

Copy PageListPermissions folder to your /site/modules/, go to Admin > Modules,
hit "Check for new modules" and install Page List Permissions. Process Page
List Permissions will be installed automatically.

## Requirements

* User Groups module: https://github.com/apeisa/UserGroups
* ProcessWire 2.3.14+ (current "dev" branch)
